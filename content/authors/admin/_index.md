Ahoy! My name is Harsha Sista and I recently completed by B.E. Mechanical Engineering degree from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, one of the finest colleges in India. A lifelong love for the final frontier and a fascination with machines from an early age manifested in me choosing to pursue Aerospace Engineering as a career. Having completed my first step, I am looking to advance my learning by getting into Graduate School.

Although I had always dreamed of becoming an engineer or a scientist, my actual journey began in my first year, when I joined various student teams, participating in competitions like SAE BAJA India, the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition and CANSAT. Working in various profiles within these teams taught me how to break complex problems into simpler parts, and gain and understanding of them intuitively. I carried this mindset forward when I started working with professors on various projects during my second and third years, learning research methodology and building my research acumen.

By this point, I was piqued by what research had to offer, and my Bachelor's Thesis at the Rotorcraft Aerodynamic Laboratory at Politecnico di Milano solidified my desrie to ultimately pursue a PhD and get into academia. I gained experience writing papers and presenting at conferences through the course of my final year project, which I am currently continuing in the capacity of a Research Assistant.

Outside the academic sphere, I have diverse interests, ranging from playing and watching various sports to catching up on fantasy novels and quizzing. I also play the piano and guitar, and love listening to music from the previous century.

I am currently looking for PhD opportunities in research labs compatible with my interests, starting Spring 2021. If you are interested in discussing potential opportunities, do let me know.
