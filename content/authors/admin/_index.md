Ahoy! My name is Harsha Sista, and I recently completed my B.E. Mechanical Engineering degree from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, one of the finest colleges in India. A lifelong love for space exploration and a fascination with machines from an early age spurred me to pursue Engineering as a career, with a focus on Mechanical and Aerospace. Having completed my undergraduation, I am looking to advance my learning by getting into Graduate School and ultimately pursuing a Ph.D.

Although I had always dreamed of becoming an engineer or a scientist, my real journey began in my first year, when I joined various student teams, participating in competitions like SAE BAJA India, the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition, and CANSAT. Working in various profiles within these teams taught me how to break complex problems into simpler parts, and gain an understanding of them intuitively. I carried this mindset forward when I started working with professors on various projects during my second and third years, learning research methodology, and building my research acumen.

By this point, I was piqued by what research had to offer. My Bachelorâ€™s Thesis at the Rotorcraft Aerodynamic Laboratory at Politecnico di Milano solidified my desire to pursue a Ph.D. and get into academia. My final year project, which I am currently continuing in the capacity of a Research Assistant, provided valuable experience in writing papers and presenting at conferences.

Outside the academic sphere, I have diverse interests, ranging from playing and watching various sports to catching up on fantasy novels and quizzing. I also play the piano and guitar and love listening to music from the previous century.

I am currently looking for Ph.D. opportunities in research labs compatible with my interests, starting Spring 2021. If you are interested in discussing potential opportunities, do let me know.
